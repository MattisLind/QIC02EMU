# QIC02EMU

![Schematic](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MattisLind/QIC02EMU/main/QIC02EMU/QIC02EMU.png)

Device that is supposed to emulate a generic QIC-02 tape drive or specifically the IBM6157 tape drive. The IBM 6157 contains a Cipher 450 tape drive. But has a 37 pin DUSB interface cable rather than the 50 pin IDC type connector.

The card is supposed to plug directly into the IBM RT PC 6157 streaming tape controller board without using any cable.

Initially only reading of tape will be supported but later on writing will be implemented.
